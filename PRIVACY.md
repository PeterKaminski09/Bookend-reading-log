### Google Books API
Google Books API is used to provide metadata about books and allow for robust search functionality. When using search on Bookend, the search terms are provided to Google Books API, as well as other device metadata. According to Google Book's privacy policy:
> This may include information such as the query term or page request (which may include book titles or specific pages within a book you are browsing), Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your account.

Bookend also displays Google Book's API provided web links that will link to an external, third-party website. These links to third-party sites may also collect data and browser information from the user.
